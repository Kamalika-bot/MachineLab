## Homework: My Project Sketch-February 5,2026 
The game I've chosen is Helix Jump. The player has to guide a bouncing ball down through a series of circular platforms arranged in a vertical helix tower. You don’t move the ball, you rotate the tower itself by swiping your finger across the screen. You must navigate the ball through the gaps in the platforms while avoiding the colored "dead zones." Touching these areas ends your run instantly. Below is a screenshot of the game:

In my model, I will use a central shaft (the "pole") that can spin freely to mimic the tower. A vertical shaft can be rotated by hand or connected to a motor via a belt/pulley system at the bottom. It will use [Movement 1](https://507movements.com/mm_001.html)

As for the ball, I'm not sure if I should use a guide rail or a back arm method for its movement. I will try to prototype the back arm method and if it's too complex, just use a guide rail. As for visual effects,I plan to add a led lights that will increase in brightness when the ball is near the disc.

## Homework: Motor Exercise & Rough Prototype - February 10,2026

Upon initially connecting the circuit, all the wire connections were right, but the motor was not turning although the arduino was on. After a lot of rechecking and playing around, I got to know that the resistor was not connected to the same row as the arduino pin on the other side of the push button. This left the arduino pin floating. Since it is not connected to the resistor, it is not connected to the ground. Thus the arduino sends 0 as a signal which the motor inputs and does'nt react. After fixing this, the motor started working and doing as exoected. 

Schematic: 

Code: 
```c++
// --- Define your pins here ---
const int enA = 9;      // PWM pin for speed control
const int in1 = 8;      // Direction pin 1
const int in2 = 7;      // Direction pin 2
const int button = 4;   // Push button pin
const int potPin = A0;  // Potentiometer pin

int rotDirection = 0;
int pressed = false;


void setup() {
  pinMode(enA, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(in1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(in2, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(button, INPUT);
  // Set initial rotation direction
  digitalWrite(in1, LOW);
  digitalWrite(in2, HIGH);
}

void loop() {
  int potValue = analogRead(A0); // Read potentiometer value
  int pwmOutput = map(potValue, 0, 1023, 0 , 255); // Map the potentiometer value from 0 to 255
  analogWrite(enA, pwmOutput); // Send PWM signal to L298N Enable pin

  // Read button - Debounce
  if (digitalRead(button) == true) {
    pressed = !pressed;
  }
  while (digitalRead(button) == true);
  delay(20);

  // If button is pressed - change rotation direction
  if (pressed == true  & rotDirection == 0) {
    digitalWrite(in1, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(in2, LOW);
    rotDirection = 1;
    delay(20);
  }
  // If button is pressed - change rotation direction
  if (pressed == false & rotDirection == 1) {
    digitalWrite(in1, LOW);
    digitalWrite(in2, HIGH);
    rotDirection = 0;
    delay(20);
  }
}
```
The motor exercise has the same circuit as the rough prototype below.

### Video of the Rough Prototype:

The circuit of the prototype is the same as the one above. The shaft attached to is connected to the motor using the hub. It's speed is controlled by the potentiometer knob and the direction is reversed everytime the push button is pressed. The motor was enough for the protoype but the actual model will have a _pulley system_ to control the system tdo offer a more stable experience. As for the back arm method ball, I just plan to use an _actuator_ connected to the back of the model to control the course of the ball. The actuator would speed up the ball when required and bring it back to the top once the game is over.

# Homework Group Prototype-1 
due Tuesday, February 17th

## Group Members - David, Kamalika, Yumi
## Game - Cyberpunk 2077

- Cyberpunk 2077 is a 2020 action role-playing game set in the fictional metropolis of Night City in California, within the dystopian Cyberpunk Universe. It is known for its cyberpunk aesthetic.

</p>

This is a rough sketch of the prototype. Some key features are described below: 
- A **night city background** which consists of buildings of varying lengths with neon led lights that flicker and are synchronised with the music and scene hapenning simultaneously. Some of them will have billboards as well.
- Train and Car Tracks that go through the air and lead into the behind of the buildings. We will use a conveyer belt mechanism for moving the train and car tracks.
- There will be a main character who is quite large compared to the rest of the project. He will be hanging by a thread and moves up and down on it. Another key feature is this character's Cyberpsychosis, due to which his arm is detached and he hangs with limp limbs
- Finally, there will be a large crowd of people moving through the pedestrian path below. This will bemade using the conveyer belt. This movement helps keep the project look dynamic and engaging.

### Prototype for class
This mechanism is the one we chose to build for class. It is used to represent the arm detaching and revealing another arm below. The strign was meant to stimulate the pulling up of the detached arm. It is attached to the metallic arm on one side and the L298 Motor on the other side. When the motor starts turning, the arm is pulled back up to join the rest of the arm.
