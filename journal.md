### Homework-February 5,2026 
The game I've chosen is Helix Jump. The player has to guide a bouncing ball down through a series of circular platforms arranged in a vertical helix tower. You don’t move the ball, you rotate the tower itself by swiping your finger across the screen. You must navigate the ball through the gaps in the platforms while avoiding the colored "dead zones." Touching these areas ends your run instantly. Below is a screenshot of the game:

In my model, I will use a central shaft (the "pole") that can spin freely to mimic the tower. A vertical shaft can be rotated by hand or connected to a motor via a belt/pulley system at the bottom. It will use [Movement 1](https://507movements.com/mm_001.html)
