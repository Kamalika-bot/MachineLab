## Homework: My Project Sketch-February 5,2026 
The game I've chosen is Helix Jump. The player has to guide a bouncing ball down through a series of circular platforms arranged in a vertical helix tower. You don’t move the ball, you rotate the tower itself by swiping your finger across the screen. You must navigate the ball through the gaps in the platforms while avoiding the colored "dead zones." Touching these areas ends your run instantly. Below is a screenshot of the game:

In my model, I will use a central shaft (the "pole") that can spin freely to mimic the tower. A vertical shaft can be rotated by hand or connected to a motor via a belt/pulley system at the bottom. It will use [Movement 1](https://507movements.com/mm_001.html)

As for the ball, I'm not sure if I should use a guide rail or a back arm method for its movement. I will try to prototype the back arm method and if it's too complex, just use a guide rail. As for visual effects,I plan to add a led lights that will increase in brightness when the ball is near the disc.

## Homework: Motor Exercise & Rough Prototype - February 10,2026

Upon initially connecting the circuit, all the wire connections were right, but the motor was not turning although the arduino was on. After a lot of rechecking and playing around, I got to know that the resistor was not connected to the same row as the arduino pin on the other side of the push button. This left the arduino pin floating. Since it is not connected to the resistor, it is not connected to the ground. Thus the arduino sends 0 as a signal which the motor inputs and does'nt react. After fixing this, the motor started working and doing as exoected. 

Schematic: 

Code: 
```c++
// --- Define your pins here ---
const int enA = 9;      // PWM pin for speed control
const int in1 = 8;      // Direction pin 1
const int in2 = 7;      // Direction pin 2
const int button = 4;   // Push button pin
const int potPin = A0;  // Potentiometer pin

int rotDirection = 0;
int pressed = false;


void setup() {
  pinMode(enA, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(in1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(in2, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(button, INPUT);
  // Set initial rotation direction
  digitalWrite(in1, LOW);
  digitalWrite(in2, HIGH);
}

void loop() {
  int potValue = analogRead(A0); // Read potentiometer value
  int pwmOutput = map(potValue, 0, 1023, 0 , 255); // Map the potentiometer value from 0 to 255
  analogWrite(enA, pwmOutput); // Send PWM signal to L298N Enable pin

  // Read button - Debounce
  if (digitalRead(button) == true) {
    pressed = !pressed;
  }
  while (digitalRead(button) == true);
  delay(20);

  // If button is pressed - change rotation direction
  if (pressed == true  & rotDirection == 0) {
    digitalWrite(in1, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(in2, LOW);
    rotDirection = 1;
    delay(20);
  }
  // If button is pressed - change rotation direction
  if (pressed == false & rotDirection == 1) {
    digitalWrite(in1, LOW);
    digitalWrite(in2, HIGH);
    rotDirection = 0;
    delay(20);
  }
}
```
The motor exercise has the same circuit as the rough prototype below.

### Video of the Rough Prototype:

The circuit of the prototype is the same as the one above. The shaft attached to is connected to the motor using the hub. It's speed is controlled by the potentiometer knob and the direction is reversed everytime the push button is pressed. The motor was enough for the protoype but the actual model will have a _pulley system_ to control the system tdo offer a more stable experience. As for the back arm method ball, I just plan to use an _actuator_ connected to the back of the model to control the course of the ball. The actuator would speed up the ball when required and bring it back to the top once the game is over.
